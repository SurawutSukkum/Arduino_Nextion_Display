# Arduino uno interface via Nextion_Display
Nextion is a Human Machine Interface (HMI) solution. Nextion displays are resistive touchscreens that makes it easy to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is a great solution to monitor and control processes, being mainly applied to IoT applications. DS18B20 is 1-Wire digital temperature sensor. The BME280 is a humidity sensor especially developed for environmental monitoring system i.e., Humidity sensor measuring relative humidity, barometric pressure and ambient temperature.
MG811 Carbon Dioxide CO2 Sensor Module is a sensor that is highly sensitive to carbon dioxide.
